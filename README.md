[Felt.social](https://felt.social)
is a community, service, and business
powered by [Felt](https://github.com/feltcoop/felt),
a set of free and open source tools for building
customizable self-governing communities.

Felt seeks to empower us,
help us organize,
and improve our communication —
[Felt.social](https://felt.social) continues this mission
by developing a sustainable business to
support communities that are effective, authentic, and humane.

Our business is owned by a worker co-op
and we're working to become
a [platform co-op](https://platform.coop)
to best serve all stakeholders.
We feel like accountability is pretty cool.
If you think so too, we hope you'll join us!
