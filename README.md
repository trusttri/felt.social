[felt.social](https://felt.social)
is a community, service, and business
powered by [`felt`](https://github.com/feltcoop/felt),
a set of free and open source tools for building customizable communities.
`felt` seeks to empower people,
help us organize,
and improve our communication â€”
[felt.social](https://felt.social) continues this mission
by developing a sustainable business to
foster communities that are thriving, inspiring, and humane.
Our business is owned by a worker co-op
and one day we hope to become
a [platform co-op](https://platform.coop)
to justly serve all stakeholders.
We feel like accountability is pretty cool
and so is a future friendly for all.
