		Felt is a set of tools for building customizable self-governing communities. It seeks to empower
		us, help us organize, and improve our communication. It's a free and open source alternative to
		many websites and apps tucked into a warm fuzzy package.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our team is small and our goals are over the top. Through the might of software we aim to help
		people solve priority problems with joy. Felt is what the web should be.
	</p>
	Felt features (one day):
	<ul>
		<li>customizable tools for online and offline communities</li>
		<li>chats and forums</li>
		<li>malleable media that we design and share</li>
		<li>advanced moderation and shared governance</li>
		<li>polls and fun interactives</li>
		<li>events and rsvps</li>
		<li>note taking and sharing</li>
		<li>tasks and todos and reminders</li>
		<li>bookmarks and aggregation and adventure</li>
		<li>p2p video, audio, messaging, etc</li>
		<li>blogs and web publishing</li>
		<li>commerce</li>
		<li>maybe one day, galaxies of interesting communities to explore</li>
		<li>client software that users fully control</li>
		<li>client software that works with many service providers in a single app</li>
		<li>server software that's easy to self-host</li>
		<li>and more! much more</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		And Felt is more than a big bag of features. It's a customizable
		<a href="https://github.com/feltcoop/felt"> open source software platform</a>, a
		<a href="https://felt.social">community and business</a>, a
		<a href="https://twitter.com/feltcoop">co-op of worker-owners</a>, and hopefully one day a
		<a href="https://platform.coop/">platform co-op</a>
		(communities owning themselves? absurd) ‚Äî all with a purpose that puts people first. If we do it
		right, Felt is tech that feels good.
	</p>
	<p>
		Felt The Business makes money (or will!) by selling value to users. Mostly this is through
		subscription services and commerce mediation like
		<a href="https://felt.social">Felt.social</a>. We want a business model that keeps our
		incentives aligned with our users, so we accept no revenue from third parties like advertisers.
		You're a person so we will treat you like one. We hope to provide an amazing customer
		experience, but you can always export your data from our service to another.
	</p>
	<p>
		The company behind Felt is a democratic worker co-op where us workers share equal ownership and
		control. We believe this model will help Felt The Business remain
		<span class="font-bold whitespace-no-wrap">‚Üí accountable ‚Üê</span>
		to its users, workers, and society. To learn more about why we chose this business structure, see
		our (forthcoming) blog post "Why Felt is a worker co-op". In the future, we want to explore the
		<a href="https://platform.coop/">platform cooperative model</a>
		to share control and ownership with our users. (you, we hope!)

		But Felt is not ready yet. We have a long road to go, and we're pointed towards community
		building and democratic governance.
