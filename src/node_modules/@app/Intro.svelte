is a community, service, and business	powered by
<a href="https://github.com/feltcoop/felt"><code>felt</code></a>,
a set of free and open source tools for building customizable communities.
<code>felt</code> seeks to empower us,
help us organize, and improve our communication â€”
felt.social continues this mission by developing a sustainable business to
foster communities that are thriving, inspiring, and humane.
Our business is owned by a worker co-op and one day we hope to
become a <a href="https://platform.coop">platform co-op</a>

We feel like accountability is pretty cool
and so is a future friendly for all.
