<h2><a href="https://felt.social">Felt.social</a></h2>
is a community, service, and business	powered by
<a href="https://github.com/feltcoop/felt">Felt</a>,
a set of free and open source tools for building
customizable self-governing communities.
Felt seeks to empower us,
help us organize, and improve our communication â€”
Felt.social continues this mission by developing a sustainable business to
foster communities that are effective, authentic, and humane.
Our business is owned by a worker co-op and one day we hope to
become a <a href="https://platform.coop">platform co-op</a>
to best serve all	stakeholders.
We feel like accountability is pretty cool.
If you think so too, we hope you'll join us!
